Capstone Project IPB-GPT

This project aims to develop an 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 for campus repositories, enhancing access to academic literature. Current platforms struggle with 𝗱𝗲𝗲𝗽, 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀 limiting researchers' ability to quickly find relevant references. By integrating 𝗰𝘂𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴-𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗡𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝗡𝗟𝗣) 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀 like 𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 and 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 (𝗟𝗟𝗠𝘀), the application enables, precise searches by topic, keyword, faculty, or paper title.
